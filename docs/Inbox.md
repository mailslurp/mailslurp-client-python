**created_at** | **datetime** | When the inbox was created. Time stamps are in ISO DateTime Format &#x60;yyyy-MM-dd&#39;T&#39;HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX&#x60; e.g. &#x60;2000-10-31T01:30:00.000-05:00&#x60;. | [optional] 
**description** | **str** | Description of an inbox for labelling and searching purposes | [optional] 
**email_address** | **str** | The inbox&#39;s email address. Send an email to this address and the inbox will receive and store it for you. Note the email address in MailSlurp match characters exactly and are case sensitive so &#x60;+123&#x60; additions are considered different addresses. To retrieve the email use the Inbox and Email Controller endpoints with the inbox ID. | [optional] 
**expires_at** | **str** | Inbox expiration time. When, if ever, the inbox should expire and be deleted. If null then this inbox is permanent and the emails in it won&#39;t be deleted.

You can still access the emails belonging to it but it can no longer send or receive email. | [optional] 
**favourite** | **bool** | Is the inbox favorited. Favouriting inboxes is typically done in the dashboard for quick access or filtering | [optional]

See the emailAddress property for the email address or the inbox. To get emails in an inbox use the WaitFor and Inbox Controller methods &#x60;waitForLatestEmail&#x60; and &#x60;getEmails&#x60; methods respectively. Inboxes can be used with aliases to forward emails automatically. | [optional] 
**name** | **str** | Name of the inbox. Displayed in the dashboard for easier search | [optional]
